# Job Vacancy Analysis in New York City

## Introduction

In the realm of IT, two significant technologies, Big Data and Cloud Computing, have taken center stage. This project focuses on the intersection of these technologies by analyzing job vacancies in New York City. The dataset provided contains information about job vacancies in various civil service departments across different locations in New York. The goal is to manipulate big data and leverage cloud computing to perform Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations for valuable insights.

## Motivation
The project is motivated by the challenge of working with big data and cloud computing, exploring their applications beyond traditional data-processing software. The scalable environment of cloud computing makes it feasible to deploy data-intensive applications for business analytics, simplifying connectivity and collaboration within organizations.

## Statement of Problem
The project aims to gain knowledge of big data and cloud computing and harness big data in the cloud. Specific objectives include:

Comparing different jobs in different cities through ETL operations.
Assisting candidates in making job choices based on various criteria.
Helping students identify cities with higher job opportunities.
Integrating Cloud Computing using AWS Web Services.
Performing queries on Amazon Athena and storing results in Amazon S3 Bucket.
Learning to visualize data on Amazon Quicksight.

## Methodology

The project involves developing job vacancy analysis incrementally using applications such as MySQL, Hive, and Spark, along with ETL tools like SQOOP. The project flow includes steps such as loading data into a relational database, creating tables in Hive, transferring data to HDFS using SQOOP, cleaning data with HiveQL, running queries on SPARK, and storing data in Amazon S3.
